{"name":"Vm","tagline":"The Variability Modeling and Configuration Language ","body":"The right language to specialize variability modeling by including additional information.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### VM special features\r\n_The most common types of additional information supported by VM are:_\r\n\r\n  - **Default** values that help to complete partial configurations, \r\n  - **Deltas** to discretise real domains, \r\n  - controlled **descriptions** in natural language about the model itself, features, attributes and constraints, \r\n  - **multi-ranges** and **multi-deltas** that allow to use several ranges and deltas to define the domain of the values of an attribute,\r\n  - **not translatable** tags a purely informative feature or attribute,\r\n  - **not decidable** tags a feature or attribute that do not help to differentiate products, \r\n  - **runtime** tags a feature or attribute that vary only at runtime,\r\n  - **objective functions** allow to filter validate configurations. For example, generating only low cost product configurations.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n_Also VM supports the most advanced characteristics in extended feature models, for example_:\r\n  - Attributed feature models\r\n  - metainformation of the main model\r\n  - metainformation of features and attributes\r\n  - Specify configurations of feature values using tables.\r\n  - Constraints using Features and Attributes as operands. \r\n  - Global functions to compute values based on features and attributes.\r\n  - Quantification when expressing constraints and global functions.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with VM?
