This paper presents the current VM tool support.\r\n- A conference paper in the industrial track was submitted to the 18th International Software Product Line Conference 2014 ([SPLC'14](http://www.splc2014.net)), Florence, Italy. This paper presents the design rational and main constructs behind VM.\r\n- A conference paper in the main research track was submitted to the International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis ([ISSTA'14](http://issta2014.org)). This paper presents pair-wise multi-objective configurations generation based on the VM language.\r\n\r\n### VM special features\r\n_The most common types of additional information supported by VM are:_\r\n  - **Default** values that help to complete partial configurations, \r\n  - **Deltas** to discretise real domains, \r\n  - controlled **descriptions** in natural language about the model itself, features, attributes and constraints, \r\n  - **multi-ranges** and **multi-deltas** that allow to use several ranges and deltas to define the domain of the values of an attribute,\r\n  - **not translatable** tags a purely informative feature or attribute,\r\n  - **not decidable** tags a feature or attribute that do not help to differentiate products, \r\n  - **runtime** tags a feature or attribute that vary only at runtime,\r\n  - **objective functions** allow to filter validate configurations. For example, generating only low cost product configurations.\r\n\r\n_Also VM supports the most advanced characteristics in extended feature models, for example_:\r\n  - Attributed feature models\r\n  - Packages and import mechanisms\r\n  - metainformation of the main model\r\n  - metainformation of features and attributes\r\n  - Specification of configurations of feature and attributes values using tables.\r\n  - Constraints that support features, attributes, values and a rich set of operations and functions.\r\n  - Quantification when expressing constraints and global functions.\r\n\r\n### Tutorials and examples\r\nPlease visit our VM project wiki [Here](https://github.com/mao2013/VM/wiki).\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nDo you still have troubles with VM?
